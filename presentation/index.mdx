# Implementation Details

## Agenda

### Implementation Details

- joke about accent
- elevator pitch
- what are they?
- strawman example
- realistic example
- how to escape them
- when to focus on them

talking about implementation details

## ðŸ§¡

<Notes>
Talking about the database to use, or the ui framework, or the way to do state management...

Challenging the design with the engineers, do we need an overlay, should these inputs start as hidden, does this flow really need three screens...

You know what I hate?

testing implementation details

## ðŸ¤¬

<Notes>

This is an engineering only pain.

You are an engineer so you want to solve problems.

You want to be confident you've solved them forever and make it easier to improve in the future. So you write tests!

But when you write tests that are too coupled to the implementation details, you sacrifice the "make it easier to improve" part for the confidence it currently works.
