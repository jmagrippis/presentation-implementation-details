listening to people talk about implentation details

## üòë

<Notes>
Sucks to be you I guess!

Let's say you have an engineering meeting between two teams, they make two different products in your company... One generates impressions for your users, the other conversions.

They have to work together to show their respective metrics in the same dashboard.

Don't let that meeting devolve to two people talking about Rabbit MQ or Server-side rendering!

Everyone should be working together and figuring out the necessary parts and who's gonna work on what.

Some UI -> they UI will need to be fed some data -> that data will be queried from a service

that service will need to talk to what? One team stores the conversions in Postgres, the other stores the impressions in BigQuery...

</Notes>

---

if you were using a `bson` column...

![zip it](https://media.giphy.com/media/StExRwBu6p1ok/giphy.gif)

<Notes>
  "the one rule of BigQuery is do not query BigQuery"

What exactly you're doing now isn't important for that meeting. We're engineers, we've queried databases before, we'll figure it out. Stay on the high level.

An important thing to uncover instead would be something like "Oh. We have no way to get the impression as we haven't implemented tracking"

That's much more important than your mastery of database schemas. Going into implementation details at that point is indulging yourself.

</Notes>

---

we kinda forgot about metrics

![kinda forgot](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/029/651/sdbdcefw1jw21.jpg)

<Notes>
  You might as well making jokes about Game of Thrones. Maybe one would be fine but such meetings are so easy to derail;

But it is indulging yourself. You wouldn't want the outcome of the meeting to be "they botched the last season".

You wouldn't want the outcome of the meeting to be "Postgres is awesome, Mongo is terrible"

The outcome of the meeting should be "we know what we're gonna do next"

... You know what I hate?

testing implementation details

## ü§¨

<Notes>

This is an engineering conference so we will be going in deeper in looking at literally writing tests which test the inmplementation details,
but don't get me wrong, I hate al forms of this.

Imagine if you were told you need to test that the button is red 100% of the time.

Easy to do... but why? Wouldn't you rather test click-throughs? Conversions?

It might sound silly but believe me in the tests that cover our code, we do often do something similar.

So, how do we even get to a place where we test implementation details?

</Notes>

---

## Problem

- You solve problems using code
- You want to be confident your code solves them forever
- You want your code to be easy to improve

<Notes>

love to solve problems, paid to

lazy engineer as all great engineers, so when you solve problems you a guarantee they're solved forever

the code you wrote last month is terrible, the code you're about to write is genius.

</Notes>

---

## Solution

- You write tests üéâ
- You are confident your code solves the problems it's currently solving forever more ‚úÖ
- But **every time** your tests are **too coupled to implementation details**, you make your code **harder** to improve üò±

<Notes>

Let's say you're joining a new team that is working on a chatbot product.

You decide to do some code archeology before your first big meeting

You find this.

</Notes>

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const getOnlineFriends = (
  friendIds: User,
  allUsers: User[]
) =>
  allUsers
    .filter(({ id }) => friendIds.includes(id))
    .filter(({ online }) => online)
```

<Notes>

You're pretty sure that in javascript this means you're traversing an array twice. You don't know if it's actually optimised out by some compiler magic,
but you're confident you can do just one `filter` instead of two here.

</Notes>

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const getOnlineFriends = (
  friendIds: User,
  allUsers: User[]
) =>
  allUsers.filter(
    ({ online, id }) => online && friendIds.includes(id)
  )
```

<Notes>

So you do it and are thinking about benchmarking if anything is noticeably faster, but you see some red.

</Notes>

---

export default ErrorSlide

Error: expected `filter`

to be called twice

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
it('only returns online friends', () => {
  const onlineFriends = getOnlineFriends(user, allUsers)
  expect(Array.prototype.filter).toBeCalledTimes(2) // ü§™

  expect(onlineFriends).toEqual([
    // ...
  ])
})
```

<Notes>
  Wait a minute? Has anybody EVER done this? The answer is
  yes. But this is the contrived example.

You put things back as you found them and look at where the method is called.

And you find something huge

</Notes>

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const allUsers = knex.select('*').from<User>('users')
const onlineFriends = getOnlineFriends(user, allUsers)
```

<Notes>
  We're literally getting all the users in the database! They're never used elsewhere, all we need is the online friends.

So never mind looping once or twice, we can loop zero times and get exactly what we want straight from the db.

</Notes>

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const onlineFriends = knex
  .select('*')
  .from<User>('users')
  .whereIn('id', user.friendIds)
  .where('online', true)
```

<Notes>
  so you add some fancy where closes to your little db
  helper and are ready to celebrate for the performance
  gainz. Right?
</Notes>

---

export default ErrorSlide

Error: `whereIn` is not a function

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const mockKnex = {}
mockKnex.select = jest.fn(() => mockKnex)
mockKnex.from = jest.fn(() => mockKnex)
jest.mock('knex', () => mockKnex)
```

<Notes>
  May I get a hands up, who's mocked their database adapter
  before?
</Notes>

### üëäüèº

![gotem](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/SuccessKid.jpg)

<Notes>
  I'll count this as a success.

What we have is "resilient to refactoring and value adds".

There are ways around it, with stores and interfaces and typescript...

</Notes>

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const user = userStore.getUserWithFriends('not-that-talk')
```

<Notes>
  But this is not that talk. This is the talk on Implementation Details.

So let's zoom back out and try to define them. What even are implementation details?

</Notes>

### What are

### implementation details?

Initial

Error - Too short

Success

<Notes>
  What are implementation details here?

The hover state on the button. Whether it's enabled while the form is invalid. Whether validation happens on blur.

Where we store the usernames as user type them.

Where we store them as users claim them...

But you know what?

</Notes>

---

the form itself is an implementation detail

![mindblown](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT0xeJpnrWC4XWblEk/giphy.gif)

---

## Goal:

## Allow users to pick a username

---

## Goal:

## Allow users to be identifiable without using their real names

<Notes>
  It is our job as engineers to understand the user goal
  just as much as it is to deliver it.

So let's say you've accepted this is the user story to deliver and you're
delivering it.

You experimented with two prototypes, both of them using React. One of them manages
state using old school React class state, the other using React's new hotness, hooks.

</Notes>

---

can you tell which uses React hooks?

<GuessTheType />

---

```typescript
typeof class OldSchool {} === typeof function NewSchool() {}
```

> `typeof` doesn't discriminate,

> should your tests?

<Notes>
  There are ways to test this that would "survive" a
  refactor from class state to hooks. In most frameworks.
</Notes>

---

There are frameworks that make testing implementation details too easy

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const component = shallow(<ChangeUsername />)
component.setState({ isValid: false })

expect(input.prop('success')).toBe(false)
expect(input.prop('error')).toBe(true)

component.setState({ isValid: true })
const input = component.find(Input)

expect(input.prop('success')).toBe(true)
expect(input.prop('error')).toBe(false)
```

<Notes>
  What does prop success even mean? Nothing to the browser.
  Nothing to the user.

This is written with the help of Enzyme by airbnb: And I'm not dissing it itself,
You can write more meaningful tests with it, and it and airbnb have helped javascript
mature so much. More than I have that's for sure.

</Notes>

---

There are frameworks that help you avoid implementation details

![testing-libary](https://i.ibb.co/fr7nJyS/testing-library.png)

testing-library.com üêô

<Notes>Initially I dismissed due to the tagline.

But now I'm doing talk about how frameworks CAN help you avoid testing
implementation details, so Kent got me this time!

When I finally did have enough with enzyme and was rendering everything using react's own Renderer,
a colleague told me that's pretty much what Testing Library is doing; only better with nice cleanup operations
and handy matchers.

</Notes>

<Notes>
  These queries are written in order of preference according to having your tests resemble the way your software is used:
  so you'd want to be telling your QA put your name in the field with the label "Username". testids are there, but they are dead last;

still ahead of using classnames though

<Notes>
  Great! Slow if you really were to BDD everything still
  cannot do everything the browser can, like input type

Still using mocha / chai...

</Notes>

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const { getByLabelText, getByText } = render(
  <ChangeUsername />
)
const input = getByLabelText('Username')

// user inputs a short username
userEvent.click(input)
userEvent.type(input, 'Pop')
userEvent.tab()

expect(getByText('that is too short')).toBeTruthy()

// user inputs a valid username
userEvent.click(input)
userEvent.type(input, 'PopCultureReference')
userEvent.tab()

expect(getByText(/claim/i)).toBeTruthy()
```

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const { getByLabelText, getByText } = render(
  <ChangeUsername />
)
const input = getByLabelText('Username')

// user inputs a "taken" username
userEvent.click(input)
userEvent.type(input, 'jmagrippis')
userEvent.tab()

expect(getByText(/checking availability/)).toBeTruthy()
expect(await findByText(/not available/).toBeTruthy()

// user inputs an available username
userEvent.click(input)
userEvent.type(input, 'notjmagrippis')
userEvent.tab()

expect(await findByText(/claim/i).toBeTruthy()
```

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
import fetchMock from 'fetch-mock'
fetchMock
  .get('/users/jmagrippis', 200)
  .get('/users/notjmagrippis', 404)
```

<Notes>

First time the user exists so the username is taken,
second time there is no such user so the username is available

Before you get upset...

</Notes>

<Notes>

This is not the "mocks are bad" talk. And mocks maintained and used by many people
are better than mocks maintained and used just by you. It's not inherently bad
to bring in an in memory postgres for your tests. I'm not saying e2e test all the things.

</Notes>

---

There is a time and place for

## Implementation details

<Notes>

Do discuss with your fellow experts

But still do discuss but do avoid it from your tests as much as possible.

So let's have one last set of code slides.

Imagine you want to refactor into using GraphQL to check whether the username is taken.

Maybe you could write your own `render` method for tests that augments the "real one" and abstracts away some mocking setup.

</Notes>

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
export function render(ui, { mocks } = {}) {
  const Wrapper = ({ children }) => (
    <MockedProvider mocks={mocks} addTypename={false}>
      {children}
    </MockedProvider>
  )

  return {
    ...render(ui, { wrapper: Wrapper }),
  }
}
```

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const { getByLabelText, getByText } = render(
  <ChangeUsername />,
  { mocks }
)
```

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const { getByLabelText, getByText } = render(
  <ChangeUsername />,
  { apolloMocks, fetchMocks }
)
```

## Implementation Details

- Can **delight** or **frustrate** your users and your team...
- ... if users see them. If the team iterates

<Notes>
  Our little form could have the best UX in the world, would it matter if nobody uses it?

Even if the same user changing their username twice sets crashes their browser, it wouldn't matter if you have evidence to suggest nobody would do it.

I hope I managed to convey the spirit of the talk...

Fulfill those user journeys and iterate fast, by knowing the time and place for implementation details.

The talk wasn't "only do MVPs". That's another danger.

Imagine you're filming a successful series. You have this ruler that you want to convey they're still human, and they're also ostracised.

So at a big party, you want them secluded sipping to have a familiar beverage. That's your user story.

</Notes>

## Implementation Details

- Be aware of them... in silence
- Do get into them in private, specialist to specialist
- After you have an idea of the high level goals
- As little as possible in your tests
