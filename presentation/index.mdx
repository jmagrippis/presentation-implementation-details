# Implementation Details

## Agenda

### Implementation Details

- joke about accent
- elevator pitch
- contrived example
- realistic example
- what even are they?
- how to escape them
- when to focus on them

<Notes>... You know what I love?</Notes>

talking about implementation details

## 🧡

<Appear>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Which database? UI Framework? State Management?
      </li>
      <li>
        Modal? Hidden inputs? Forcefully open in a new tab?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</Appear>

Has APPEAR

... You know what I dislike?

listening to people talk about implentation details

## 😑

<Notes>
Sucks to be you guys I guess!

Let's say you have an engineering meeting between two teams, same company two different products...

They have to work together to show their respective conversion stats in the same dashboard.

Don't let that meeting devolve to two people talking about Rabbit MQ or Server-side rendering! Everyone should be working together and figuring out the necessary parts and who's gonna work on what. Some UI -> they UI will need to be fed some data -> that data will be extracted from a service -> that service needs to talk to BigQuery

... You know what I hate?

testing implementation details

## 🤬

<Notes>

This is an engineering only pain, but his is a mostly engineering conference so we'll be focusing on it.

How do we even get to a place where we test implementation details?

</Notes>

---

## Problem

- You solve problems using code
- You want to be confident your code solves them forever
- You want your code to be easy to improve

---

## Solution

- You write tests 🎉
- You are confident your code solves the problems it's currently solving forever more ✅
- But **every time** your tests are **too coupled to implementation details**, you make your code **harder** to improve 😱

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const getOnlineFriends = (
  friendIds: User,
  allUsers: User[]
) =>
  allUsers
    .filter(({ id }) => friendIds.includes(id))
    .filter(({ online }) => online)
```

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const getOnlineFriends = (
  friendIds: User,
  allUsers: User[]
) =>
  allUsers.filter(
    ({ online, id }) => online && friendIds.includes(id)
  )
```

---

Error: expected `filter` to be called twice

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
it('only returns online friends', () => {
  const onlineFriends = getOnlineFriends(user, allUsers)
  expect(Array.prototype.filter).toBeCalledTimes(2) // 🤪

  expect(onlineFriends).toEqual([
    // ...
  ])
})
```

<Notes>
  Wait a minute? Has anybody EVER done this? The answer is
  yes. But this is the contrived example.
</Notes>

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const allUsers = knex.select('*').from<User>('users')
const onlineFriends = getOnlineFriends(user, allUsers)
```

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const friends = knex
  .select('*')
  .from<User>('users')
  .whereIn('id', user.friendIds)
  .where('online', true)
```

---

Error: `.whereIn` is not a function

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const mockKnex = {}
mockKnex.select = jest.fn(() => mockKnex)
mockKnex.from = jest.fn(() => mockKnex)
jest.mock('knex', () => mockKnex)
```

### What are implementation details?

---

Let's say we've got this design:

![design](https://lvivity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mobile-forms.jpg)

---

Even the form is an implementation detail!

---

## Goal: Allow users to pick a username

---

## Goal: Allow users to be identifiable without using their real names

---

can you tell which uses React hooks?

<GuessTheType />

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
typeof class OldSchool {} === typeof function NewSchool() {}
```

> `typeof` doesn't discriminate, why should your tests?

---

One set of tests errors, one passes

---

There are frameworks that make testing implementation details too easy

---

export default CodeSlide

```typescript
const component = shallow(<ChangeUsername />)
component.setState({ isValid: false })

expect(input.prop('success')).toBe(false)
expect(input.prop('error')).toBe(true)

component.setState({ isValid: true })
const input = component.find(Input)

expect(input.prop('success')).toBe(true)
expect(input.prop('error')).toBe(false)
```

---

There are frameworks that help you avoid implementation details

  Great! Slow if you really were to BDD everything still
  canot do everything the browser can, like input type slide
  Still using mocha / chai But testing library...

## Implementation Details

- Can delight or frustrate your users... if they get there
- Can delight or frustrate your team... if you do iterate

---

## Implementation Details

- Be aware of them... in silence
- Do get into them in private, specialist to specialist
- After you have an idea of the high level goals
- As little as possible in your tests

---

## Implementation Details

- This presenation was written in `mdx`
- Using Spectacle from Formidable Labs
- Hosted on Netlify
- Example on Code Sandbox
